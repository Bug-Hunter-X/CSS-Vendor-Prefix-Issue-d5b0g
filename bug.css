The CSS code uses a vendor prefix that is no longer necessary or supported by modern browsers. For example, using `-webkit-`, `-moz-`, or `-ms-` prefixes for properties that have standard cross-browser support can lead to unexpected rendering inconsistencies or even break the layout.  This can happen even if the standard, unprefixed property is also included, as the browser might prioritize the prefixed version.
